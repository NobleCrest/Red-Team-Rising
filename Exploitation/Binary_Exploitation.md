# CTF Binary Exploitation Steps    

        file binary     #note architechure of the binary, are debugging symbols stripped?     
        strings binary   #note strings, 
If a binary is not stripped of debugging symbols:    

        readelf -s program     
Open the binary in Ghidra, run 
ltrace: record library calls made in an executable to see what context they are used in.      

        ltrace ./program      

## Format String Vulnerabilities     
Is user input pased to printf, scanf or similiar functions in a way you can control?    

        %x%x   #test as user input   

        
## GEF    
[GEF Documentation](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/)    
Extend the features of GDB.    
Check security protections on a binary:     

    checksec filename  
    checksec     #if gdb is already attached to a process
