# CTF Binary Exploitation Steps    

        file binary     #note architechure of the binary, are debugging symbols stripped?     
        strings binary   #note strings, function calls   
If a binary is not stripped of debugging symbols:    

        readelf -s program     
Open the binary in Ghidra, decompile it and look at the source code.   
ltrace: record library calls made in an executable to see what context they are used in.      

        ltrace ./program      

## Format String Vulnerabilities     
Is user input passed to printf, scanf or similiar functions in a way you can control?    

        printf(variable);   //c code vulnerability   
        %x%x   #test as user input   
        %p %p    #print out pointer values - test to see if you can disclose vital info (like a flag)  
But what if the string contains a format parameter?? The format function should eval and try to access the function arg by adding to the frame pointer - if arg isn't there adding to the frame pointer will reference a piece of memory in a preceding stack frame.

## GEF    
[GEF Documentation](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/)    
Extend the features of GDB.    
Check security protections on a binary:     

    checksec filename  
    checksec     #if gdb is already attached to a process    

    pattern create 200    #create a pattern   
    pattern offset waab   #get the offset
